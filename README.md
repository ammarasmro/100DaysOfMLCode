# 100 Days of ML Code challenge

## Day 0: Friday, July 6, 2018
**Progress**: Studied search in non-deterministic environments from the [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) Book

**Thoughts**: I have been following this book for a while. I first started by reading chapter 22 which covers NLP but then I started from the beginning and now I'm chapter 4. Searching algorithms in deterministic and nondeterministic environments are helping me understand AI more and in knowing how to approach open-ended problems. I'm hoping to finish this book and start implementing those algorithms one by one.

## Day 1: Saturday, July 7, 2018
**Progress**: Started the day looking into building a chatbot in the Kurdish Language. I had the preprocessing pipeline ready so I built a sequential Keras model. The data I used where recorded phone conversations. I kept having the loss getting stuck at certain values so to study the dataset further I started turning the data into a Neo4j graph to understand the language better. I will publish my work as soon as I reach interesting results. This is part of my [Applications of NLP on the Kurdish Language project](https://github.com/ammarasmro/Kurdish-Language)

**Thoughts**: Today just confirmed my belief that just because we have all the tools and fancy algorithms doesn't mean that we can just throw data at it without understanding what's happening. I think that those experiences are much more valuable than any lesson or any course.
