# 100 Days of ML Code challenge

**Progress**: Studied search in non-deterministic environments from the [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) Book

**Thoughts**: I have been following this book for a while. I first started by reading chapter 22 which covers NLP but then I started from the beginning and now I'm chapter 4. Searching algorithms in deterministic and nondeterministic environments are helping me understand AI more and in knowing how to approach open-ended problems. I'm hoping to finish this book and start implementing those algorithms one by one.
