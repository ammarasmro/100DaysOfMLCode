# 100 Days of ML Code challenge

## Day 0: Friday, July 6, 2018
**Progress**: Studied search in non-deterministic environments from the [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) Book

**Thoughts**: I have been following this book for a while. I first started by reading chapter 22 which covers NLP but then I started from the beginning and now I'm chapter 4. Searching algorithms in deterministic and nondeterministic environments are helping me understand AI more and in knowing how to approach open-ended problems. I'm hoping to finish this book and start implementing those algorithms one by one.

## Day 1: Saturday, July 7, 2018
**Progress**: Started the day looking into building a chatbot in the Kurdish Language. I had the preprocessing pipeline ready so I built a sequential Keras model. The data I used where recorded phone conversations. I kept having the loss getting stuck at certain values so to study the dataset further I started turning the data into a Neo4j graph to understand the language better. I will publish my work as soon as I reach interesting results. This is part of my [Applications of NLP on the Kurdish Language project](https://github.com/ammarasmro/Kurdish-Language)

**Thoughts**: Today just confirmed my belief that just because we have all the tools and fancy algorithms doesn't mean that we can just throw data at it without understanding what's happening. I think that those experiences are much more valuable than any lesson or any course.

## Day 2: Sunday, July 8, 2018
**Progress**: As another step in the Kurdish Language NLP applications. I tried to build a word embedding. I got my data from the Kurdish Wikipedia and finished processing it into a useful format for such a task. I started training the embedding and will continue refining my network and verifying the results by asking a native Kurdish person to check the word similarity.

**Thoughts**: I have used embedding many times but I had to brush up on my knowledge by following the tutorials on Tensorflow website and Google ML crash course. My knowledge allowed me to get up to speed in less than a day but it also means that I need to keep practicing those skills so that I don't forget them.
